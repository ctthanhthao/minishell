# 🐚 Minishell

A simplified Unix shell written in C. This project is part of the 42 curriculum and aims to recreate a functional command-line shell supporting execution, pipes, redirections, built-ins, and more.

## 📋 Subject Summary

### ✅ Mandatory Requirements

- Display a prompt and wait for user input
- Handle input history (using `readline`)
- Command execution using relative/absolute path or `$PATH`
- Signal handling (with at most one global variable)
- Handle quoting:
  - `'` (single quotes prevent all interpretation)
  - `"` (double quotes allow `$` expansion)
- Redirections:
  - `<`, `>`, `>>`, `<<` (heredoc)
- Pipes (`|`)
- Environment variable expansion (`$VAR`, `$?`)
- Signal handling:
  - `Ctrl-C` → prompt refresh
  - `Ctrl-D` → exit shell
  - `Ctrl-\` → ignored
- Built-in commands:
  - `echo` with `-n`
  - `cd` (absolute or relative path)
  - `pwd`
  - `export`
  - `unset`
  - `env`
  - `exit`

### 🌟 Bonus Features

- `&&`, `||` and parentheses for priority
- Wildcard `*` expansion (current working directory)
